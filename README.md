# MergeMKV
MergeMKV is a simple and powerful tool for merging single or multiple video and audio files. This Python script uses the FFMPEG tool to automatically combine audio (MP3) and video (MP4 or MKV) files that have the same name. Outputs are saved in MKV format and all operations are performed automatically with progress display.
